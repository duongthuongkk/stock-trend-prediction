# stock-trend-prediction
This project describes a model that can predict the changes of stocks after each minute. To process the time series in the dataset, I choose a LSTM architecture to solve it. Then, I use the Tensorflow framework to train this model and evaluate it. If you want to know more information, please open a ```stock_predictor.ipynb``` file.
