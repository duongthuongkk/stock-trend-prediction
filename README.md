# stock-trend-prediction
This project describes a model that can predict the changes of stock after each minutes. To process the time series in dataset, I choose a LSTM architecture to solve it. Then, I use the Tensorflow framework to train this model and evaluate it. If you want to know more information, please open a LSTM.ipynb file.
